For two weeks I ignored the corona virus. I saw people spreading messages of fear and panic. I said no way, not me. Then I read [this](https://www.fast.ai/2020/03/09/coronavirus/) article. The risk from the virus is to our hospitals, and my actions have a direct impact. Wow. I felt like an idiot. Why hadn't I read more about this before? Why didn't I listen to friends warning me earlier? What can I do now?

By reducing our social contacts, we can **slow down the virus**.

This helps to **keep our hopsitals open**.

Every action contributes.

Every action helps.

[covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid_19) is happening.

We can each do our part to help.

## Slow down the spread

We likely cannot avoid the virus. We can **slow it down**. The more slowly the virus spreads, the better our healthcare system can cope.

* Reduce your social contacts
* Wash your hands with soap
* Avoid touching your face

Every time you avoid one social contact, or wave instead of shaking hands, you make an impact. Your actions can keep our hospitals open, and help to save lives.

## Keep hospitals open

The big risk here is hospitals being too busy to cope. By reducing our social contacts, we slow the spread of the virus. By slowing the spread of the virus, we reduce the number of people going to hospital. This makes it easier for hospitals to cope. This means our most vulnerable neighbours will still receive medical care during this period.

## You really do make a difference

Each person's actions truly does make an impact here.

Every time 2 people meet, there's some small chance that the virus infects 1 more person. The less often his happens, the less chances the virus has to spread. It's that simple. Less meetings, more hand washing, slower spread.

## Difficult

You may feel worry or even panic about this virus. This is natural. We're facing something we've never experienced before. You may also consider that it is possible to think differently. You may consider that by choosing to take action, you are helping the situation. You may focus on supporting your friends and family to do the same.

## Wash your hands
