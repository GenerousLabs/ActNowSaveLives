Every little helps

[covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid_19) is happening.

We can each do our part to help.

We likely cannot avoid the virus. We can slow it down. The more slowly the virus spreads, the better our healthcare system can cope.

* Reduce your social contacts
* Wash your hands with soap
* Avoid touching your face

Every time you avoid one social contact, or wave instead of shaking hands, you make an impact. Your actions can keep our hospitals open, and help to save lives.
